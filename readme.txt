IMPORTANT:
credentials.js file is needed. In it a Credentials class with a "login" property is needed. The "login" property is a Discord Bot token. Without it, you cannot connect your program to a bot.

In the bot developer portal Privileged Gateway Intents part, you need to enable SERVER MEMBERS INTENT option.
